# Base Data Product Template

This template seeds a new data product folder during onboarding.

## Folders

- `workspace/` – placeholder for Fabric workspace exports and artifacts
- `pipelines/` – data pipeline JSON definitions ready for deployment
- `notebooks/` – notebooks to be synchronized with Fabric Git integration
- `datasets/` – semantic model and dataset resources
- `docs/` – product-specific documentation, runbooks, and design notes

Add or remove folders here to change the scaffold generated for new products.
