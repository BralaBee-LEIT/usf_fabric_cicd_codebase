# Feature Branch Workflow Scenario - Summary

## What You Discovered

You correctly identified that **all earlier scenarios** (config-driven-workspace, leit-ricoh-setup, domain-workspace) were missing a critical component: **feature branch workflows**.

## The Gap

### What Previous Scenarios Covered
- ✅ Creating permanent DEV/TEST/PROD workspaces
- ✅ Environment-based configurations
- ✅ Domain-based organization
- ✅ User/group assignments
- ✅ Lakehouse/warehouse creation

### What Was Missing
- ❌ Feature branch workspace creation
- ❌ Git branch + workspace linking
- ❌ Ticket-based isolated development
- ❌ Parallel development workflows
- ❌ PR-based code review integration
- ❌ Complete developer journey from ticket to production

## The Solution

Created **`scenarios/feature-branch-workflow/`** - a comprehensive scenario demonstrating:

### New Files Created

1. **README.md** - Overview, use cases, workflow diagram
2. **FEATURE_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md** - Complete step-by-step guide (30+ sections)
3. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick commands and troubleshooting
4. **WHAT_WAS_MISSING.md** - Detailed comparison with previous scenarios
5. **product_descriptor.yaml** - Sample product configuration
6. **test_feature_workflow.sh** - Automated test script

### Key Capabilities

```bash
# The missing command that creates feature workspaces
python3 ops/scripts/onboard_data_product.py \
  product_descriptor.yaml \
  --feature JIRA-12345
```

**Creates:**
- Feature workspace: `Customer Insights-feature-JIRA-12345`
- Git branch: `feature/customer_insights/JIRA-12345`
- Git connection: Workspace ↔ Branch (bidirectional sync)
- Scaffold structure: `data_products/customer_insights/`

## How It Fits Into CI/CD

This scenario **completes the picture** by showing how the CI/CD pipeline we explored earlier actually works:

```
Developer Gets Ticket
         ↓
Creates Feature Workspace (NEW SCENARIO)
         ↓
Develops in Isolation
         ↓
Creates Pull Request
         ↓
GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
  ├─ Code Quality
  ├─ Unit Tests
  ├─ DQ Validation
  └─ Security Scan
         ↓
PR Approved & Merged
         ↓
Auto-Deploy to DEV (Previous Scenarios' Workspaces)
         ↓
Promote to TEST (Fabric Deployment Pipeline)
         ↓
Promote to PROD (Fabric Deployment Pipeline)
```

## Comparison: Before vs. After

### Before (All Previous Scenarios)
```
Create Workspace Command:
├─ config-driven: Creates DEV/TEST/PROD (permanent)
├─ leit-ricoh: Creates project workspace (permanent)
├─ domain-workspace: Creates domain workspace (permanent)
└─ NO way to create feature branch workspaces

Developer Workflow:
├─ Everyone works in shared DEV workspace
├─ Changes interfere with each other
└─ No isolation between tickets
```

### After (With Feature Branch Workflow)
```
Create Workspace Commands:
├─ config-driven: Creates DEV/TEST/PROD (permanent)
├─ leit-ricoh: Creates project workspace (permanent)
├─ domain-workspace: Creates domain workspace (permanent)
└─ feature-branch: Creates feature workspace (temporary) ⭐ NEW

Developer Workflow:
├─ Each ticket gets isolated workspace
├─ Git branch automatically created
├─ Safe parallel development
├─ PR-based workflow integration
└─ Complete CI/CD integration
```

## Test Script

Created executable test script: `test_feature_workflow.sh`

**What it does:**
1. Checks prerequisites (.env, scripts)
2. Runs dry-run preview
3. Creates feature environment
4. Verifies Git branch creation
5. Checks scaffold structure
6. Reviews audit log
7. Provides cleanup instructions

**Usage:**
```bash
cd scenarios/feature-branch-workflow
./test_feature_workflow.sh
```

## Integration with Existing Knowledge

This scenario ties together everything we've learned:

1. **From CI/CD Architecture Discussion:**
   - GitHub Actions 7-stage pipeline
   - Fabric Deployment Pipelines (stage promotion)
   - Git Integration (workspace ↔ Git sync)
   - **NOW CLEAR:** How feature work flows into this pipeline

2. **From Earlier Scenarios:**
   - config-driven-workspace: Creates target DEV/TEST/PROD
   - **feature-branch-workflow:** Creates isolated development environments
   - **Integration:** Feature merges → DEV → TEST → PROD

3. **From Project Lessons Learned:**
   - Capacity-id requirement
   - Questioning assumptions
   - Dual workflows
   - **NOW COMPLETE:** Developer journey documented
