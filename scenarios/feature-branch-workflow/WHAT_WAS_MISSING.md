# Scenario Comparison: What Was Missing

## Executive Summary

**The Gap:** All previous scenarios (config-driven-workspace, leit-ricoh-setup, domain-workspace) created permanent DEV/TEST/PROD workspaces but **none demonstrated feature branch workflows** - the isolated, ticket-based development pattern that's critical for the CI/CD pipeline.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

### Before (Previous Scenarios)

```
Scenario: config-driven-workspace
─────────────────────────────────
Creates:
✅ DEV workspace
✅ TEST workspace  
✅ PROD workspace
❌ NO feature branches
❌ NO ticket-based isolation
❌ NO Git branch creation

Use Case: Environment setup
Workflow: Everyone works in shared DEV workspace
```

```
Scenario: leit-ricoh-setup
──────────────────────────
Creates:
✅ DEV workspace
✅ Lakehouse, Warehouse, Notebooks, Pipeline
❌ NO feature branches
❌ NO ticket-based isolation
❌ NO Git integration

Use Case: Quick project setup
Workflow: Direct workspace provisioning
```

```
Scenario: domain-workspace
──────────────────────────
Creates:
✅ Domain-based workspace
✅ Lakehouse, Warehouse, Staging
✅ User/group access
❌ NO feature branches
❌ NO ticket-based isolation
❌ NO Git integration

Use Case: Domain organization
Workflow: Departmental workspace structure
```

### After (Feature Branch Workflow)

```
Scenario: feature-branch-workflow
─────────────────────────────────
Creates:
✅ DEV workspace (if doesn't exist)
✅ Feature workspace (isolated)
✅ Git feature branch
✅ Git connection (workspace ↔ branch)
✅ Scaffold structure
✅ Ticket-based naming

Use Case: Ticket-based development
Workflow: Isolated workspace per JIRA ticket
Command: onboard_data_product.py --feature JIRA-123
```

## What Each Scenario Tests

| Scenario | Purpose | Creates Feature Workspace? | Creates Git Branch? | Ticket-Based? |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **config-driven-workspace** | Environment setup | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **leit-ricoh-setup** | Quick project bootstrap | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **domain-workspace** | Domain organization | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **feature-branch-workflow** | **Ticket development** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## The Missing Piece Explained

### Problem Without Feature Branches

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│      DEV Workspace (Shared)              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Developer A: Working on JIRA-101       │
│  Developer B: Working on JIRA-102       │
│  Developer C: Testing breaking changes  │
│                                          │
│  ⚠️  PROBLEMS:                           │
│  • Changes collide                      │
│  • Can't experiment safely              │
│  • Hard to track who did what           │

### Solution With Feature Branches

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Isolated Feature Workspaces                     │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Developer A: Product-feature-JIRA-101                 │
│               ↕️ feature/product/JIRA-101               │

│                                                         │
│  ✅ BENEFITS:                                           │
│  • Complete isolation per ticket                       │
│  • Safe experimentation                                │
│  • Clear ownership                                     │
│  • Automatic Git sync                                  │
│  • PR-based code review                                │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## CI/CD Integration

### Previous Scenarios: Missing the Link

```
Previous scenarios created DEV/TEST/PROD but didn't show:
❌ How developers work on individual tickets
❌ How feature work flows into DEV via PR
❌ How Git branches connect to workspaces
❌ How parallel development happens
```

### Feature Branch Workflow: Complete Picture

```
Developer → Feature Workspace → Feature Branch → PR → DEV → TEST → PROD
   ↓              ↓                    ↓          ↓     ↓      ↓      ↓
 Ticket      Isolated Work        Git Commits  Review Auto  Manual Manual
JIRA-123    in dedicated WS      feature/...          Deploy Promote Promote
```

**Now the CI/CD pipeline makes sense:**
- **Feature Branch** (developer working in isolation)
  ↓
- **Pull Request** (code review trigger)
  ↓
- **CI/CD Validation** (GitHub Actions: quality, tests, DQ)
  ↓
- **Merge to main** (approved)
  ↓
- **Auto-deploy to DEV** (Stage 5 in pipeline)
  ↓
- **Promote to TEST** (Stage 6, manual approval)
  ↓
- **Promote to PROD** (Stage 7, manual approval)

## Commands Comparison

### Standard Workspace Setup (Previous)
```bash
# Creates DEV/TEST/PROD - no feature branches
python3 config_driven_workspace.py \
  --project customer-analytics \
  --environment dev

# Result: Permanent workspace, no Git branch
```

### Feature Branch Workflow (New)
```bash
# Creates DEV + Feature workspace + Git branch
python3 onboard_data_product.py \
  product_descriptor.yaml \
  --feature JIRA-12345

# Result:
# ✅ Feature workspace: Customer Insights-feature-JIRA-12345
# ✅ Git branch: feature/customer_insights/JIRA-12345
# ✅ Git connection: Workspace linked to branch
# ✅ Scaffold: Project structure in Git
```

## When to Use Each Scenario

### Use config-driven-workspace When:
- Setting up permanent DEV/TEST/PROD environments
- Creating multi-environment workspace structure
- Onboarding new projects (initial setup)
- Configuring environment-specific settings

### Use leit-ricoh-setup When:
- Quick project initialization
- Creating workspace with pre-defined items
- Legacy project migration
- Testing workspace creation

### Use domain-workspace When:
- Organizing workspaces by business domain
- Creating departmental workspaces
- Setting up domain-based access control
- Managing cross-functional data products

### Use feature-branch-workflow When:
- ✅ **Working on specific tickets/stories**
- ✅ **Need isolated development environment**
- ✅ **Multiple developers on same product**
- ✅ **Testing risky/breaking changes**
- ✅ **Following PR-based code review**
- ✅ **Need Git branch per feature**

## Real-World Workflow Example

### Week 1: Initial Setup (Previous Scenarios)
```bash
# Step 1: Create project environments (config-driven)
python3 config_driven_workspace.py --project customer-analytics --environment dev
python3 config_driven_workspace.py --project customer-analytics --environment test
python3 config_driven_workspace.py --project customer-analytics --environment prod

# Result: 3 permanent workspaces created
```

### Week 2: Feature Development (New Scenario)
```bash
# Developer gets JIRA-12345 assigned
python3 onboard_data_product.py product_descriptor.yaml --feature JIRA-12345

# Developer works in isolated workspace
# Changes auto-sync to feature/customer_analytics/JIRA-12345 branch
# Create PR when ready
# After merge → auto-deploys to DEV
```

### Week 3: Parallel Development
```bash
# Developer A: JIRA-12346
python3 onboard_data_product.py product_descriptor.yaml --feature JIRA-12346

# Developer B: JIRA-12347 (parallel, same product)
python3 onboard_data_product.py product_descriptor.yaml --feature JIRA-12347

# Both work independently, no conflicts
```

### Week 4: Promote to Production
```bash
# Both features merged to DEV, tested, ready for PROD
# Use Fabric Deployment Pipeline (from earlier CI/CD architecture)
python3 ops/scripts/deploy_fabric.py \
  --deployment-pipeline-id $PIPELINE_ID \
  --source-stage 0 \
  --target-stage 1 \
  --mode promote  # DEV → TEST

# After TEST validation
python3 ops/scripts/deploy_fabric.py \
  --deployment-pipeline-id $PIPELINE_ID \
  --source-stage 1 \
  --target-stage 2 \
  --mode promote  # TEST → PROD
```

## Key Insights

### 1. Two Types of Workspaces
- **Permanent:** DEV/TEST/PROD (created by previous scenarios)
- **Temporary:** Feature workspaces (created by new scenario)

### 2. Two Types of Workflows
- **Environment Setup:** One-time creation of DEV/TEST/PROD
- **Feature Development:** Repeated creation of feature workspaces per ticket

### 3. Integration Point
```
Feature Workspace → Feature Branch → PR → DEV Workspace → TEST → PROD
  (temporary)         (Git)        (Review) (permanent)
```

### 4. Complete Developer Journey
```
Day 1: Get ticket JIRA-12345
       ↓
Day 1: Create feature workspace (new scenario)
       python3 onboard_data_product.py ... --feature JIRA-12345
       ↓
Day 2-4: Develop in isolated workspace
       ↓
Day 5: Create PR from feature branch
       ↓
Day 5: CI/CD validates (GitHub Actions)
       ↓
Day 6: PR approved and merged
       ↓
Day 6: Auto-deploy to DEV (previous scenarios' workspaces)
       ↓
Day 7: Promote to TEST (manual approval)
       ↓
Day 8: Promote to PROD (manual approval)
       ↓
Day 8: Cleanup feature workspace & branch
```

## Summary: The Gap is Filled

**Before:** We had environment setup scenarios but no ticket-based development workflow.

**Now:** Complete end-to-end workflow from ticket assignment → isolated development → code review → deployment → production.

**Missing scenarios we had:**
- ❌ How to work on individual tickets
- ❌ How to create isolated workspaces
- ❌ How to link Git branches to workspaces
- ❌ How feature work flows into CI/CD pipeline

**Now covered with feature-branch-workflow:**
- ✅ Ticket-based workspace creation
- ✅ Git branch + workspace linking
- ✅ Isolated parallel development
- ✅ PR-based workflow integration
- ✅ Complete developer journey from ticket to production

---

**This scenario completes the picture - it connects individual developer work to the CI/CD pipeline architecture we explored earlier!** 🎯
