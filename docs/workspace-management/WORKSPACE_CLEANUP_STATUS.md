## üìä Portal vs API Discrepancy

### What the Fabric Portal Shows (from screenshot):

| # | Workspace Name | Status | Capacity | Trial ID |
|---|----------------|--------|----------|----------|
| 1 | `leit-ricoh` | **Active** | Workspace | Trial-2025100BT23J8092... |
| 2 | `testingnotebooks` | **Active** | Workspace | Trial-2025100BT23J8092... |
| 3 | `usf-fabric-fabric-dev` | **Deleted ‚ìò** | Workspace (cicd-platform - DEV) | - |
| 4 | `usf-fabric-fabric-test` | **Deleted ‚ìò** | Workspace (cicd-platform - TEST) | - |
| 5 | `usf-fabric-fabric-prod` | **Deleted ‚ìò** | Workspace (cicd-platform - PROD) | - |
| 6 | `usf2-fabric-fabric-dev` | **Deleted ‚ìò** | Workspace (testing2 - DEV) | - |
| 7 | `usf2-fabric-fabric-test` | **Deleted ‚ìò** | Workspace (testing2 - TEST) | - |
| 8 | `usf2-fabric-fabric-prod` | **Deleted ‚ìò** | Workspace (testing2 - PROD) | - |

**Total**: 11 workspaces (2 active, 6 soft-deleted, 3 more soft-deleted not shown)

### What the Fabric API Returns:

```
Active workspaces: 0
Soft-deleted workspaces: Not accessible via API
```

## üéØ Analysis

### Successful Deletions ‚úÖ
The following 6 workspaces were successfully deleted via API:
- `usf-fabric-fabric-dev`
- `usf-fabric-fabric-test`
- `usf-fabric-fabric-prod`
- `usf2-fabric-fabric-dev`
- `usf2-fabric-fabric-test`
- `usf2-fabric-fabric-prod`

**Status**: Soft-deleted (7-day retention period)  
**Action Required**: None - will be permanently deleted automatically

### Not Detected by API ‚ö†Ô∏è
Two workspaces appear in portal but not in API:
- `leit-ricoh`
- `testingnotebooks`

**Possible Reasons**:
1. **Different tenant** - These workspaces belong to a different Azure tenant
2. **Permissions** - Service principal doesn't have access to these workspaces
3. **Personal workspaces** - Created under your personal account, not service principal's tenant
4. **Shared workspaces** - You have guest access but they're not in your tenant

---

## üîç Verification Steps

### Check Which Tenant You're Authenticated To:

```bash
# Check service principal tenant
grep AZURE_TENANT_ID .env

# Check workspaces the service principal can see
python -c "
from ops.scripts.utilities.workspace_manager import WorkspaceManager
wm = WorkspaceManager()
workspaces = wm.list_workspaces()
print(f'Workspaces accessible to service principal: {len(workspaces)}')
"
```

### Check Portal Authentication:

1. In Fabric portal, click your profile (top right)
2. Check which account you're signed in with
3. Check the tenant/directory shown

### Compare:
- **Portal tenant** vs **Service principal tenant**
- If they're different, that explains why API sees 0 but portal sees 2

## üéØ To Delete the 2 Active Workspaces

### Option 1: Delete Manually via Portal
1. Go to each workspace (`leit-ricoh`, `testingnotebooks`)
2. Click workspace settings (gear icon)
3. Click "Remove this workspace"

### Option 2: Switch to Portal Tenant for API Access
If you want to manage these via API:

1. **Get the correct tenant ID** from the portal
2. **Update `.env`** with that tenant ID
3. **Create service principal** in that tenant
4. **Run deletion** with new credentials

### Option 3: Keep Them
If these are personal/test workspaces you want to keep, no action needed.

## üìù Microsoft Fabric Soft Delete Behavior

### Soft Delete Period: **7 days**

After deletion:
- **Day 0-7**: Workspace shows as "Deleted ‚ìò" in portal
  - Can be restored manually via portal
  - Not accessible via API
  - Does not consume capacity
  
- **After Day 7**: Workspace permanently deleted
  - Cannot be restored
  - All data permanently removed
  - Removed from portal view

### To Restore a Soft-Deleted Workspace:
1. Go to Fabric portal
2. View workspaces list
3. Click "..." menu on deleted workspace
4. Click "Restore workspace"

**Note**: Restoration must be done within 7 days

## ‚úÖ Current Status Summary

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Active (in your service principal tenant)** | 0 | ‚úÖ Clean |
| **Active (in other tenant/personal)** | 2 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual action needed |
| **Soft-deleted** | 6+ | ‚è≥ Auto-delete in 7 days |

---

## üöÄ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Identify tenant** of `leit-ricoh` and `testingnotebooks`
2. **Decide if you want to keep them** or delete them
3. **If delete**: Use manual portal deletion or get proper service principal
4. **Wait 7 days** for soft-deleted workspaces to be permanently removed
