## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| API changes breaking integration | High | Medium | Version pin APIs, add compatibility tests |
| Authentication failures in production | High | Low | Comprehensive auth testing, fallback mechanisms |
| Performance issues with large datasets | Medium | Medium | Performance testing, implement batching |
| Missing API permissions | High | Medium | Document required permissions, validation script |
| Great Expectations version incompatibility | Medium | Low | Pin version, test before upgrades |

---

## Conclusion

This tracking document provides a clear roadmap for completing all placeholder implementations. The recommended approach is:

1. **Prioritize DQ Gate** (Phase 1) - Critical for production quality assurance
2. **Implement Governance Tools** (Phase 2) - Purview and Power BI for full operations
3. **Add Enhancements** (Phase 3) - Package bundleimprovements

**Total Estimated Effort:** 83-111 hours (10-14 days of development)

**Recommended Team:** 2-3 developers working in parallel can complete all implementations in 2-3 sprints.
