- 🔒 `DELETE <count>` for bulk operations
- 🔒 `DELETE ALL` for environment-wide deletion
- 🚫 `--yes` flag bypasses for automation

### User Experience
- 📋 Lists workspaces before deletion
- 🗑️ Real-time progress updates
- ✅ Success/failure tracking
- 📊 Detailed summary statistics
- 💬 File format supports comments

### Integration
- 🎯 Unified CLI interface
- 🏗️ Consistent with existing commands
- 🔧 Environment filtering support
- 🐛 Comprehensive error handling
- 📝 Fully documented

## 🧪 Testing Completed

| Test Case | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| delete-bulk with IDs | ✅ | Deleted 2 workspaces |
