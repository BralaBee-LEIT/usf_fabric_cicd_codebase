## 🏗️ What Will Be Created (When You Run Setup)

### **Workspaces**
- ✅ ETL Platform [DEV]
- ✅ ETL Platform [TEST]
- ⚠️ ETL Platform [PROD] (disabled by default, enable when ready)

### **Lakehouses (3)**
```
BronzeLakehouse   → Raw data ingestion
SilverLakehouse   → Cleaned, validated data
GoldLakehouse     → Business-ready metrics
```

### **Warehouse (1)**
```
AnalyticsWarehouse → SQL analytics for Power BI
```

### **Notebooks (3)**
```
01_DataIngestion      → Load sources → Bronze
02_DataTransformation → Bronze → Silver (clean)
03_DataAggregation    → Silver → Gold (aggregate)
```

### **Pipelines (2)**
```
Pipeline_DataIngestion     → Orchestrate ingestion
Pipeline_Transformation    → Orchestrate full ETL
```

### **Users (4 - Template, customize emails)**
```
Admin        → data-admin@company.com
Member       → data-engineer@company.com
Contributor  → data-analyst@company.com
Viewer       → stakeholder@company.com
```

**Total:** 9 Fabric items + 4 users = Complete ETL environment

---

## 🚀 How to Execute

### **Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)**

```bash
cd /home/sanmi/Documents/J\'TOYE_DIGITAL/LEIT_TEKSYSTEMS/1_Project_Rhico/usf-fabric-cicd

# Run automated setup (creates everything)
./setup_etl_workspace.sh
```

**Runtime:** ~5-10 minutes  
**Creates:** All 9 items automatically  
**Verification:** Built into script

---

### **Option 2: Manual Step-by-Step**

```bash
# 1. Create workspaces
python3 ops/scripts/onboard_data_product.py \
  data_products/onboarding/etl_platform.yaml

# 2. Add users (update emails first)
python3 ops/scripts/manage_workspaces.py add-user \
  --workspace "ETL Platform [DEV]" \
  --email "your-email@company.com" \
  --role Admin

# 3. Create items individually (see ETL_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
python3 ops/scripts/manage_fabric_items.py create \
  --workspace "ETL Platform [DEV]" \
  --name "BronzeLakehouse" \
  --type Lakehouse

# ... (repeat for all items)
```

**Runtime:** ~15-20 minutes  
**Control:** Full control over each step  
**Best for:** Learning, customization

## 🎯 ETL Architecture

```
Sources → Bronze → Silver → Gold → Warehouse → Reports
         (Raw)   (Clean)  (Agg)   (SQL)      (BI)
```

### **Medallion Design Pattern:**

1. **Bronze Layer** (BronzeLakehouse)
   - Raw data ingestion
   - No transformations
   - Retention: 90 days

2. **Silver Layer** (SilverLakehouse)
   - Cleaned, validated data
   - Deduplication, schema enforcement
   - Retention: 365 days

3. **Gold Layer** (GoldLakehouse)
   - Business-ready aggregations
   - Customer segments, sales KPIs
   - Retention: Indefinite

4. **Analytics Layer** (AnalyticsWarehouse)
   - SQL query engine
   - Power BI connections
   - DirectQuery + Import modes

---

## 📊 Sample Use Case: Customer Analytics

### **Data Flow Example:**

```
Step 1: Ingestion (01_DataIngestion.ipynb)
├─ Load customers.csv → bronze_customers
├─ Load orders.json → bronze_orders
└─ Load products.parquet → bronze_products

Step 2: Transformation (02_DataTransformation.ipynb)
├─ Clean bronze_customers → silver_customers
│  ├─ Remove duplicates
│  ├─ Validate emails
│  └─ Add age_group column
├─ Clean bronze_orders → silver_orders
│  └─ Filter invalid orders
└─ Clean bronze_products → silver_products

Step 3: Aggregation (03_DataAggregation.ipynb)
├─ RFM Analysis → gold_customer_segments
│  ├─ Calculate recency, frequency, monetary
│  └─ Segment: Champions, Loyal, At Risk
├─ Sales Summary → gold_sales_summary
│  └─ Daily revenue, order count, avg value
└─ Load to AnalyticsWarehouse

Step 4: Business Consumption
├─ Power BI dashboard connects to warehouse
├─ Excel exports via API
└─ Stakeholders view reports
```

□ Conda environment active (fabric-cicd)
□ Python 3.11.14 verified
□ Azure authentication working
□ "Customer Insights" domain exists
□ User emails ready (for add-user commands)

□ Fabric capacity assigned (for workspaces)
```

**Verify prerequisites:**

```bash
# Check environment
conda activate fabric-cicd
python3 --version

# Check credentials
cat .env | grep -E "AZURE_CLIENT_ID|AZURE_TENANT_ID"

# Test authentication
python3 ops/scripts/manage_workspaces.py list
```

---

## 🔧 Customization Options

### **Change Domain:**

```yaml
product:
  domain: "Your Domain Name"  # Change from "Customer Insights"
```

### **Change Workspace Name:**

Edit YAML file:
```yaml
product:
  name: "Your ETL Platform"  # Change from "ETL Platform"
```

### **Add More Environments:**

Enable PROD in YAML:
```yaml
environments:
  prod:
    enabled: true  # Change from false
```

### **Customize Items:**

Modify `setup_etl_workspace.sh`:
- Add/remove lakehouses
- Change notebook names
- Add more pipelines

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue: "Workspace already exists"**
```bash
# Solution: Use existing workspace or delete old one
python3 ops/scripts/manage_workspaces.py delete \
  --workspace "ETL Platform [DEV]"
```

### **Issue: "User email not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Verify user exists in Azure AD
# Or use Object ID instead:
python3 ops/scripts/manage_workspaces.py add-user \
  --workspace "ETL Platform [DEV]" \
  --user-id "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" \
  --role Admin
```

### **Issue: "Capacity not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Use trial capacity for DEV/TEST
# Edit YAML: capacity_type: "trial"
```
