# Complete User Story 1 Workflow - Live Microsoft Fabric

**Date:** 21 October 2025  
**User Story:** US-001 - Automate Workspace for New Data Product  
**Environment:** Live Microsoft Fabric  
**Status:** ✅ Production-Ready

---

## 📋 Overview

This guide demonstrates the **complete end-to-end workflow** for User Story 1 when running against **live Microsoft Fabric**. Every step shows actual commands, expected outputs, and validation checkpoints.

---

## 🎯 What User Story 1 Delivers

When you run the complete workflow, you get:

1. ✅ **DEV workspace** created in Fabric (standardized naming: `<ProductName>-dev`)
2. ✅ **Git folder structure** created in repository with standard template
3. ✅ **Feature branch** created in Git (naming: `feature/<product>/<timestamp>`)
4. ✅ **Feature workspace** created in Fabric (naming: `<ProductName>-feature-<branch>`)
5. ✅ **Git connection** established between feature workspace and branch
6. ✅ **Audit trail** logged with all operations
7. ✅ **Template scaffolding** applied (notebooks/, pipelines/, datasets/, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Complete Workflow - Step by Step

### Prerequisites ✓

```bash
# 1. Verify environment
cd /path/to/usf-fabric-cicd
conda activate fabric-cicd
python --version  # Should be 3.11.14

# 2. Verify credentials
grep -E "AZURE_TENANT_ID|AZURE_CLIENT_ID|AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET" .env
grep -E "GITHUB_TOKEN|GITHUB_ORG|GITHUB_REPO" .env

# 3. Test authentication
python3 -c "from ops.scripts.utilities.workspace_manager import WorkspaceManager; mgr = WorkspaceManager(); print(f'✅ Connected. Found {len(mgr.list_workspaces())} workspaces')"
```

---

## 📝 Step 1: Create Product Descriptor (YAML)

This is your "order form" - it describes what you want created.

```bash
# Create descriptor file
cat > data_products/onboarding/customer_analytics.yaml << 'EOF'
product:
  name: "Customer Analytics"
  owner_email: "data-team@company.com"
  domain: "Customer Insights"

environments:
  dev:
    enabled: true
    capacity_type: "trial"  # or "capacity" for paid capacity
    description: "Development workspace for customer analytics"

git:
  organization: "${GITHUB_ORG}"      # Uses value from .env
  repository: "${GITHUB_REPO}"       # Uses value from .env
  feature_prefix: "feature"
  directory: "data_products/customer_analytics"

automation:
  audit_reference: "JIRA-12345"
EOF

echo "✅ Product descriptor created: data_products/onboarding/customer_analytics.yaml"
```

**What this defines:**
- Product name → becomes workspace name prefix
- Owner email → for notifications/documentation
- Domain → for organization/categorization
- Environment → DEV workspace will be created
- Git settings → where to create folder structure and feature branch
- Audit reference → for compliance tracking

---

## 🎬 Step 2: Run the Onboarding Script

This is the **single command** that executes the entire User Story 1 workflow:

```bash
# Correct syntax: descriptor path is a positional argument
python3 ops/scripts/onboard_data_product.py \
  data_products/onboarding/customer_analytics.yaml

# Preview what would happen (dry-run):
python3 ops/scripts/onboard_data_product.py \
  data_products/onboarding/customer_analytics.yaml \
  --dry-run

# Create feature workspace/branch for specific ticket:
python3 ops/scripts/onboard_data_product.py \
  data_products/onboarding/customer_analytics.yaml \
  --feature JIRA-12345
```

**Note:** The script reads environment settings (dev/test/prod) from the YAML file itself, not from command-line arguments.

---

## 📊 Step 3: Watch the Automated Process

Here's what happens automatically (you'll see this in terminal output):

### Phase 1: Validation & Environment Loading (2 seconds)
```
ℹ️ Loaded 53 environment variables from .env
ℹ️ Starting onboarding for product 'Customer Analytics' (slug: customer_analytics)
```

### Phase 2: Git Folder Structure Creation (1 second)
```
✅ Seeded scaffold for customer_analytics from template
   Template: data_products/templates/base_product
   Created: data_products/customer_analytics/
```

**✅ Acceptance Criteria 2 SATISFIED:** Git folder linkage established

Folder structure created:
```
data_products/customer_analytics/
├── workspace/
│   └── .gitkeep
├── notebooks/
│   └── .gitkeep
├── pipelines/
│   └── .gitkeep
├── datasets/
│   └── .gitkeep
├── docs/
│   └── .gitkeep
└── README.md
```

### Phase 3: DEV Workspace Creation (5 seconds)
```
ℹ️ Creating Fabric workspace: Customer Analytics [DEV]
✅ Created workspace 'Customer Analytics [DEV]'
   ID: be8d1df8-9067-4557-a179-fd706a38dd20
   Capacity: trial
   URL: https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/groups/be8d1df8-9067-4557-a179-fd706a38dd20
```

**✅ Acceptance Criteria 1 SATISFIED:** DEV workspace created

### Phase 4: Registry & Audit Logging (1 second)
```
✅ Updated onboarding registry at data_products/registry.json
✅ Audit log written to .onboarding_logs/20251021T123502Z_customer_analytics.json

  "timestamp": "20251021T123502Z",
  "product": {
    "name": "Customer Analytics",
    "slug": "customer_analytics"
  },
  "dev_workspace": {
    "id": "be8d1df8-9067-4557-a179-fd706a38dd20",
    "displayName": "Customer Analytics [DEV]",
    "description": "Development workspace for customer analytics"
  },
  "scaffold_path": "data_products/customer_analytics",
  "registry_updated": true
}
```

### Phase 5-7: Feature Branch & Workspace (Optional - Only with --feature flag)

## ✅ Step 4: Verify the Results

### Verify in Microsoft Fabric Portal

1. **Open Fabric Portal:**
   ```
   https://app.fabric.microsoft.com
   ```

2. **Check Workspaces Created:**
   - Navigate to: Workspaces
   - You should see:
     * ✅ `Customer Analytics [DEV]` (DEV workspace)
     * ✅ `Customer Analytics [FEATURE-JIRA-12345]` (Feature workspace)

3. **Check Git Connection:**
   - Open feature workspace
   - Look for Git sync icon in toolbar
   - Should show: Connected to `feature/customer-analytics/20251021-143045`

### Verify via CLI

```bash
# List all workspaces
python3 ops/scripts/manage_workspaces.py list

# Get DEV workspace details
python3 ops/scripts/manage_workspaces.py get --name "Customer Analytics [DEV]"

# Get feature workspace details
python3 ops/scripts/manage_workspaces.py get --name "Customer Analytics [FEATURE-JIRA-12345]"

# Check Git status
cd data_products/customer_analytics
git status
git log --oneline -1
```

### Verify Git Repository

```bash
# Check folder structure created
ls -la data_products/customer_analytics/
# Expected:
# workspace/
# notebooks/
# pipelines/
# datasets/
# README.md

# Check feature branch exists
git branch -a | grep "customer-analytics"
# Expected:
# remotes/origin/feature/customer-analytics/20251021-143045

# View branch on GitHub
# https://github.com/YourOrg/usf-fabric-cicd/tree/feature/customer-analytics/20251021-143045
```

## 🔄 Step 5: Development Workflow (Post-Onboarding)

After onboarding completes, developers can work in the feature workspace:

### A. Create Items in Feature Workspace

```bash
# Navigate to feature workspace in Fabric portal
# Or use CLI:

# Create lakehouse
python3 ops/scripts/manage_fabric_items.py create \
  --workspace "Customer Analytics [FEATURE-JIRA-12345]" \
  --name "CustomerDataLakehouse" \
  --type Lakehouse \
  --description "Customer data storage"

# Create notebook
python3 ops/scripts/manage_fabric_items.py create \
  --workspace "Customer Analytics [FEATURE-JIRA-12345]" \
  --name "CustomerETLNotebook" \
  --type Notebook \
  --description "ETL processing"

# Create pipeline
python3 ops/scripts/manage_fabric_items.py create \
  --workspace "Customer Analytics [FEATURE-JIRA-12345]" \
  --name "DailyCustomerPipeline" \
  --type DataPipeline \
  --description "Daily customer data pipeline"
```

### B. Sync Changes to Git

```bash
# In Fabric portal feature workspace:
# 1. Click "Source control" → "Commit to Git"
# 2. Add commit message: "Added customer ETL components"
# 3. Click "Commit"

# Or use API (if available):
# This syncs all workspace items to the connected Git branch
```

### C. Create Pull Request

```bash
# After committing to feature branch:
gh pr create \
  --base main \
  --head feature/customer-analytics/20251021-143045 \
  --title "Customer Analytics Data Product - Initial Setup" \
  --body "Completed onboarding for Customer Analytics product
  
## Changes

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Insufficient Capacity

```
Error: No available capacity for workspace creation
```

**Solution:**
- Use trial capacity: `capacity_type: "trial"`
- Or request capacity from Fabric admin
- Or specify existing capacity ID

### Issue 2: Git Authentication Failure

```
Error: Failed to connect workspace to Git - authentication failed
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify GITHUB_TOKEN has correct permissions:
# - repo (full access)
# - workflow (if using GitHub Actions)

# Test token:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
```

### Issue 3: Workspace Name Conflict

```
Error: Workspace with name 'Customer Analytics [DEV]' already exists
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Option A: Delete existing workspace
python3 ops/scripts/manage_workspaces.py delete --name "Customer Analytics [DEV]" --force

# Option B: Use different product name in YAML
# Option C: Add environment suffix to avoid collision
```

### Issue 4: Network Timeout

```
Error: Request timeout when creating workspace
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Set timeout environment variable
export FABRIC_API_TIMEOUT=300  # 5 minutes

# Retry the onboarding
python3 ops/scripts/onboard_data_product.py \
  data_products/onboarding/customer_analytics.yaml
```
