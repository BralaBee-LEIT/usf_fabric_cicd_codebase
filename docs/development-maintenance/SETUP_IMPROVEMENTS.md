# Setup Script Improvements - October 16, 2025

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

The `quick_setup.sh` script has been updated to properly handle the conda environment setup based on the project's `environment.yml` file.

## ✅ New Behavior

### **1. Environment Detection**
The script now:
- ✅ Checks if conda is installed
- ✅ Looks for `environment.yml` file
- ✅ Detects if `fabric-cicd` environment exists
- ✅ Verifies you're running in the correct environment
- ✅ Uses Python 3.11 as specified in `environment.yml`

### **2. Automatic Environment Creation**
If the environment doesn't exist:
```bash
./quick_setup.sh
# Output: Creating conda environment from environment.yml...
# Creates the environment automatically
# Then prompts you to activate it
```

### **3. Environment Validation**
If you're in the wrong environment (e.g., `base`):
```bash
# Running from base environment
./quick_setup.sh
# Output: ⚠️  Not in fabric-cicd environment (currently in: base)
#         Please run: conda activate fabric-cicd
#         Then re-run this script
```

### **4. Correct Setup Flow**
When in the correct environment:
```bash
conda activate fabric-cicd
./quick_setup.sh
# Output: ✅ Already in fabric-cicd environment
#         ✅ Python 3.11.14 (from fabric-cicd environment)
#         [continues with validation...]
```

## 📋 Proper Setup Procedure

### **First Time Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Create the conda environment (if not exists)
cd /path/to/usf-fabric-cicd
conda env create -f environment.yml

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate fabric-cicd

# 3. Run the setup script
./quick_setup.sh

# 4. Install additional dependencies (if needed)
pip install -r ops/requirements.txt
```

### **Subsequent Usage:**
```bash
# Always activate first
conda activate fabric-cicd

# Then use any commands
./fabric-cli.sh ls
./quick_setup.sh
make list
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **Before (Incorrect):**
```bash
# Used whatever Python was available
# Worked with base conda environment
# No environment validation
```

### **After (Correct):**
```bash
# Checks for conda and environment.yml
# Creates fabric-cicd environment if missing
# Validates you're in the correct environment
# Uses Python 3.11 from fabric-cicd environment
# Exits with clear message if in wrong environment
```

## 🎯 Why This Matters

1. **Consistent Dependencies**: Everyone uses the same Python version (3.11) and packages
2. **Isolated Environment**: No conflicts with other projects or system Python
3. **Reproducible Setup**: `environment.yml` defines exact requirements
4. **Prevents Errors**: Can't run scripts in wrong environment accidentally

## 📚 Related Files

- `environment.yml` - Conda environment definition (Python 3.11 + dependencies)
- `ops/requirements.txt` - Python packages installed via pip
- `quick_setup.sh` - Setup validation script (now environment-aware)
- `fabric-cli.sh` - CLI wrapper (automatically loads .env variables)

## ✅ Verification

To verify everything is working:

```bash
# 1. Check conda environments
conda env list
# Should show: fabric-cicd

# 2. Activate environment
conda activate fabric-cicd

# 3. Verify Python version
python --version
# Should show: Python 3.11.x

# 4. Run setup
./quick_setup.sh
# Should show: ✅ Already in fabric-cicd environment

# 5. Test CLI
./fabric-cli.sh ls
# Should list your workspaces
```

## 🚀 Benefits

- ✅ No more "wrong Python version" errors
- ✅ No more dependency conflicts
- ✅ Clear error messages when setup is incorrect
- ✅ Automatic environment creation
- ✅ Consistent setup across all team members
